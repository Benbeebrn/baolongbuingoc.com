    <marquee direction="right">I love my school very much. I go to school every day to study. My school is located in
      the center of the commune. My school has 4 buildings. Each building is 5 stories high. They are arranged in a U
      shape. My school yard has many trees. There are very large tree trunks. One person can’t hug them all. My school
      has many classes. In addition, my school also has a library to read books, a canteen for us to buy food during
      recess. My classroom is on the 3rd floor. I like the hallways of my school. The corridor is wide and there are
      small potted plants to make the space fresher. My school doesn’t have an elevator. Every time there was a class on
      the 5th floor we would have to walk up. When I was a student, I was attached to this school. I love it so much. I
      always try to keep the school and classroom clean. My friends and I spread the word not to litter. Every month we
      will clean the school together to keep the school clean.</marquee>
